# void-autoconfig
* My preferred desktop env's, software, and configs for void from minimal installation.

* i3 is my main tiling window manager of choice but I occasionaly want to install another WM/DE depending on the device so included is a choice of i3, bspwm, kde, and gnome. i3 is currently pre-configured for my liking and the other env's are vanilla at the moment.

* The void-autoconfig.sh is pretty self explanitory.

* I personally keep all my repos in ```~/git``` , be sure to make that directory and clone the repo there as there is some logic expecting that location for the time being.
